            <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Type</th>
            <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">How SEO Can Impact the Success</th>

            <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">In a landscape where business owners face specific challenges, SaaS platforms provide essential assistance with these issues.</td>
